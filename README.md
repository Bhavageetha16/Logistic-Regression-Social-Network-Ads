#  Logistic Regression on Social Network Ads

This project demonstrates how to build a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (optional)

---

##  Dataset Info

- **File**: Social_Network_Ads.csv
- **Features**: Age, Estimated Salary
- **Target**: Purchased (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

##  Steps Performed

1. Data Preprocessing (select features, scaling, split train/test)
2. Logistic Regression model training
3. Prediction on test set
4. Evaluation using accuracy score & confusion matrix
5. Visualization of decision boundaries

##  Model Evaluation

| Metric              | Value (Example) |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy            | ~89% (approx.)  |
| Confusion Matrix    |
